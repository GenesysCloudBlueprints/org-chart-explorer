This Genesys Cloud Developer Blueprint, [Genesys Cloud Users API](https://developer.genesys.cloud/useragentman/users/ "Goes to the User API page") provides access to user configuration data and a users' relationship is defined by their `manager`. The Genesys Cloud API retrieves user relationships and details about users, including their name, department, and profile picture. Using a reactive approach, the app handles large API queues and rate limits.

You can view the complete blueprint and download the sample files from [here](https://github.com/GenesysCloudBlueprints/org-chart-explorer/blob/main/blueprint/index-draft "Opens in the Org Chart Explorer page") in GitHub.
